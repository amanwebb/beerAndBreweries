# beerAndbreweries
## Repository for Doing Data Science Project 1
This project aims to gain insight on breweries across the US and the types of beer they make.
We will look at the alcohol by volume and bitterness for different types of beer.
The report that follows will conduct an analysis of brewery data collected from all 50 states 
and Washington, D.C. about 558 US Breweries and 2410 US craft beers. We will analyze beer 
bitterness and alcohol content by state, as well as, the relationship between the bitterness 
and alcohol content.
